# R Analysis of Primary Election Data

This project was done at Univision Noticias, "Bernie Sanders failed to win over minority voters" ([English](http://www.univision.com/univision-news/united-states/data-analysis-bernie-sanders-failed-to-win-over-minority-voters) | [Spanish](http://www.univision.com/noticias/univision-data/sanders-no-convencio-a-los-sectores-mas-desprotegidos-que-el-dijo-representar)). The project took data from the primary elections, broken down by county, and correlated it with census data to see which voter demographics were correlated with which candidates. The analyses showed that Bernie Sanders' success was positively correlated with counties that have higher populations of affluent voters and educated voters, and negatively correlated with counties that had higher populations of unemployed voters. These demographics were contradictory to his platform, which may be indicative of why he didn't gain the nomination.
