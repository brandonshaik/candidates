# R Analysis of Primary Election Data

This project was done at Univision Noticias, "Bernie Sanders failed to win over minority voters" ([English](http://www.univision.com/univision-news/united-states/data-analysis-bernie-sanders-failed-to-win-over-minority-voters) | [Spanish](http://www.univision.com/noticias/univision-data/sanders-no-convencio-a-los-sectores-mas-desprotegidos-que-el-dijo-representar)). The project took data from the primary elections, broken down by county, and correlated it with census data to see which voter demographics were correlated with which candidates.
